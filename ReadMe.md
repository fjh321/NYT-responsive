# NYT Responsive Webpage!

### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML and CSS to code this project.



### Lessons Learned :

- The implementation of some flexbox helped the flow of my page as opposed to using floats.
- Media queries are essential with floated elements
- Hiding content is also crucial in providing flow to a webpage
